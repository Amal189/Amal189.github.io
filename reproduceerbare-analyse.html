<p>In dit hoofdstuk wordt een analyse uitgevoerd op data uit een <em>C. elegans</em>-experiment. Tijdens dit experiment werden nematoden van de soort <em>Caenorhabditis elegans</em> blootgesteld aan verschillende concentraties van een aantal chemicaliën. De geteste stoffen zijn: 2,6-diisopropylnaphthalene, decaan, naftaleen, ethanol en S-medium.</p>
<p>Voor de analyse zijn de volgende variabelen in de dataset relevant:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>RawData</strong>: het aantal nakomelingen dat is geteld per conditie.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>compName</strong>: de naam van het chemicalie waaraan de wormen zijn blootgesteld.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>compConcentration</strong>: de concentratie van het gebruikte chemicalie.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>expType</strong>: een aanduiding of het gaat om een experimentele conditie of een controle (negatieve controle of vehiclecontrole).</li>
</ul>
<p>De dataset is afkomstig van het HU-lectoraat <em>Innovative Testing in Life Sciences &amp; Chemistry</em>.<br />
Het doel van deze analyse is om de gegevens op een reproduceerbare manier te verwerken en visualiseren in een RMarkdown-bestand. Hiervoor worden de volgende R-packages gebruikt:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>readxl</code> voor het inlezen van de Excel-bestanden<br />
</li>
<li><code>drc</code> voor het uitvoeren van dose-response analyse<br />
</li>
<li><code>ggplot2</code> voor het maken van grafieken
<strong>Data-inlees en inspectie</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Om de data correct te kunnen analyseren, is het belangrijk om de stappen zorgvuldig te doorlopen.</p>
<div id="stap-1-data-opslaan-en-inlezen" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="5.1.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.1.1</span> Stap 1: Data opslaan en inlezen<a href="reproduceerbare-analyse.html#stap-1-data-opslaan-en-inlezen" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>De eerste stap is om het Excel-bestand met de experimentele data op een vaste locatie op je laptop op te slaan, bijvoorbeeld in een map genaamd <code>raw_data</code>. Vervolgens geef je het pad naar dit bestand in R en lees je het in met behulp van de functie <code>read_excel()</code> uit het <code>readxl</code>-pakket. Als extra controle kun je de ingelezen data weergeven in een tabelvorm met behulp van de <code>reactable</code>-functie.</p>
<p>Onderstaande code laat zien hoe je dit doet:</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.1.2</span> Stap 2: Inspecteren van de datatypes<a href="reproduceerbare-analyse.html#stap-2-inspecteren-van-de-datatypes" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>In deze stap controleer je of de kolommen van de dataset correct zijn ingelezen en of ze de goede datatype hebben. Dit is belangrijk, omdat foutieve datatypes — bijvoorbeeld een getal dat als tekst is ingelezen — problemen kunnen veroorzaken in de verdere analyse.</p>
<p>Op basis van de inhoud van de dataset wordt verwacht dat <strong>RawData</strong> zal uit <strong>numerieke waarden (numeric)</strong> bestaan, <strong>compName</strong> uit <strong>tekst (character)</strong>, en <strong>compConcentration</strong> ook <strong>numeriek</strong> zal zijn.</p>
<p>Er zijn verschillende manieren om data te inspecteren. Ik laat hieronder twee methodes zien.</p>
<p><strong>Manier 1</strong>: De <code>class()</code> functie gebruiken per kolom</p>
<p>Met de <code>class()</code> functie kun je het datatype van één specifieke kolom bekijken:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb3-1"><a href="reproduceerbare-analyse.html#cb3-1" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co"># Inspecteer &quot;RawData&quot; m.b.v class</span></span>

<pre><code>## [1] &quot;character&quot;</code></pre>
<p><strong>Manier 2</strong>: Meerdere kolommen tegelijk controleren met <code>select()</code> en <code>map()</code></p>
<p>Bij deze methode kies je meerdere kolommen tegelijk met <code>select()</code> uit het <code>dplyr</code>-pakket. Vervolgens pas je met <code>map()</code> uit het <code>purrr</code>-pakket de functie <code>class()</code> toe op elke kolom, zodat je van alle geselecteerde kolommen het datatype kan bekijken.</p>

<p>Uit stap twee blijkt dat de kolom <strong>compConcentration</strong> als <strong>character</strong> (tekst) is ingelezen, terwijl verwacht dat dit een numeriek datatype zou zijn. Voor een correcte analyse en visualisatie is het belangrijk dat de concentraties als getallen worden herkend. Daarom zet je deze kolom nu om naar numeriek met behulp van <code>mutate()</code> uit het <code>dplyr</code>-pakket.</p>

<p>Bij deze stap kun je een scatter plot maken m.b.v <code>ggplot</code> om het effect van verschillende concentraties en chemicaliën op het aantal nakomelingen van <em>C. elegans</em> te visualiseren. De concentratie worden op de x-as (log10-schaal) en het aantal nakomelingen (RawData) op de y-as weergegeven.

Elke compound is aangeduid met een eigen kleur en per experimenttype (controle of test) is een ander symbool gebruikt. De punten zijn licht verschoven met jitter om overlapping te voorkomen.</em></p>
<p>De positieve controle voor dit experiment is ethanol, weergegeven met een driehoekig symbool. Ethanol staat bekend om zijn remmende effect op de voortplanting en wordt gebruikt om de experimentele gevoeligheid aan te tonen. De negatieve controle is S-medium, aangeduid met een cirkel, dat geen effect heeft op de voortplanting en dus de basislijn vormt voor vergelijking.</p>
<p>Er is een duidelijke negatieve correlatie te zien tussen de compoundconcentratie en het aantal nakomelingen. Hogere concentraties leiden tot minder nakomelingen, wat suggereert dat deze stoffen toxisch zijn voor de voortplanting. Vooral bij decane en bij de hoogste concentratie van naphthalene is het aantal nakomelingen sterk verminderd.</p>

<p><strong>Wat is normalizeren en waarom normaliseren?</strong></p>
<p>Dit houdt in dat de waarden voor elke stof worden uitgedrukt als een fractie van de negatieve controle, waarbij de gemiddelde waarde van de negatieve controle (S-medium) wordt ingesteld op 1. Door deze normalisatie kunnen we de effecten van de verschillende chemicaliën op de voortplanting van de wormen direct vergelijken, ongeacht de absolute schaal van de gemeten waarden. Dit helpt om de variatie tussen de verschillende experimenten te verminderen en maakt het eenvoudiger om de relatieve toxiciteit van de chemicaliën te beoordelen.</p>

<p>In deze dosis-responsanalyse hebben we de IC50-waarden bepaald voor vier chemische verbindingen op basis van hun effect op <em>C. elegans</em>. De IC50 (de concentratie waarbij 50% van het maximale effect wordt bereikt) geeft een indicatie van de toxiciteit van een stof: hoe lager de IC50, hoe toxischer de stof is voor de wormen.</p>
<p>Uit de resultaten blijkt het volgende:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>2,6-diisopropylnaphthalene</strong> heeft de laagste IC50 (~0.025), wat wijst op een <strong>zeer hoge toxiciteit</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Decane</strong> heeft ook een relatief lage IC50 (~0.12), wat duidt op <strong>matige tot hoge toxiciteit</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Ethanol</strong> laat een hogere IC50 zien (~1.19), en is dus <strong>minder toxisch</strong> in vergelijking met de vorige twee.</li>
<li><strong>Naphthalene</strong> heeft de hoogste IC50 (~3.13), wat suggereert dat het <strong>de minst toxische stof</strong> is van de vier.</li>
</ul>
<p>Deze resultaten geven waardevolle inzicht in de relatieve toxiciteit van deze verbindingen voor <em>C. elegans</em> en vormen een basis voor verder toxicologisch onderzoek.</p>
